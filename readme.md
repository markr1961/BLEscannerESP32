Simple BLE scanner

All output is dumped to the serial port, so it should work on any ESP32 dev board.

Based on https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/tree/master/libraries/BLE/examples/BLE_scan

To configure the Arduino IDE to build and program ESP32 devices see https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/getting_started.html
or follow the link from https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32

Board manager:  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json

Arduino board:  "ESP32 Dev Module" All other settings at default. 
Should look at "DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT V1" as a possible build target.
